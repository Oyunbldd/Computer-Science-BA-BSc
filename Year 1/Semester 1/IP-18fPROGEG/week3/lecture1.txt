Programming Lecture 1:

-- Steps of creating a computer program --
1.Specification (from what?) -> Specification
2.Design (with what? how?) -> data + algorithmic description
3.Coding (how by computer?) -> code (representation + implementation)
4.Testing (any errors/bugs?) -> list of errors (dianosis)
5.Searching for bugs (where is the bug?) -> location and finding reason of bug
6.Correction (how would it be correct?) -> correct program
7.Quality assurance, efficiency (could we make it better? how?) -> good program
8.Documentation (how does it work?) -> usable program
9.Usage, maintenance (is it still ok?) -> durable program 


Specification ::
Aim: give the task in formalized way

Components:
 - Input data (identifier, set of value)
   - Information about the input -> We called it Precondition
 - Output, result (indentifier, set of values)
 - The statement used to be get the result -> We called it Postcondition
 
Tools of specification:
 - Text description
 - Mathematical formulas
 
Task -> Specification -> Algorithm
