The Collatz Conjecture states that for any positive
natural number n, this process:
if n is even, divide it by 2
if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1
repeat
will eventually reach n = 1.
Eg.: if n = 20, the resulting sequence will be:
[ 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 ]
20 / 2 = 10
10 / 2 = 5
(5 * 3) + 1 = 16
16 / 2 = 8
8 / 2 = 4
4 / 2 = 2
2 / 2 = 1
Given this number n, print out this sequence.

obtained as a result of prime factorization (excluding 1).
The first few Smith numbers are 4, 22, 27, 58, 85, 94, 121 ...

27's prime factors are 3*3*3, and 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
The smallest number in the range [3, 27]
