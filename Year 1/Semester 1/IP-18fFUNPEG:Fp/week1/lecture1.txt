Functional Programming :
  - Allows programs to be written clearly
  - the closest programming style to mathematical writing , thinking
  - the basic element of the computation is the Functional
  

Syntax :
The syntax of a programming language is the set of rules applied to describe a problem

f(a) => f a
f(a,b) + cd => f a b + c * d
f(g(b)) => f (g b)
f(a)g(b) => f a * g b

Course content:
    - how to write functions -> definition, guards, recursive functions
    - datastructures -> lists , tuple, record, array, class
    - higher order functions -> map, fold, iterate
    - types -> simple types, algebraic types, composite types, trees
    - algorithms -> search, sort, traverse

    This course we using Clean programming language.
