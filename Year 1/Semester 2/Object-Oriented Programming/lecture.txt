Procedural vs. Object-orienteed Programming

- Procedural programming : the solution is structured into independent units
- Oop : Parts of the data needed for the solution and the related activities (called methods) are structured into independent units


Task : In a series there are natural numbers between 0 and m. Which element is the most frequent? 

- There are several ways to solve it,
    - Procedural solution: Counting embedded in maximum search,
        * Let's find the maximum occurrence of the numbers between 0 and m,
        * Let's find the maximum occurrence of the elemnts in a series.

    - Object-oriented solution: we place the elements into a container (collection)
      where insertion and maximum search are quick.
        * Bag containing numbers betwen 0 and m 
        * Bag containing any natural number.

First of all, we need to analysis and planning then solve
