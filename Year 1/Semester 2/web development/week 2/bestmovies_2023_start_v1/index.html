          Although for some people cinema means something superficial and
          glamorous, it is something else. I think it is the mirror of the
          world.

        I love movies about the Internet. As someone who has grown up just as
        much on the web as off it, I feel as if it’s my virtual home, and
        inherently connect to films with social networks or hacking or viral
        media as major plot points perhaps more than films about any other
        subject.These movies thematically explore different aspects of the
        web, revealing both the positive and negative affects of living in
        such a connected world.

        <h2><i>The Social Network</i></h2>
        <p>
          Harvard student <b>Mark Zuckerberg </b>creates the
          <b> social networking site </b>that would become known as
          <b>Facebook</b>, but is later sued by two brothers who claimed he
          stole their idea, and the co-founder who was later squeezed out of
          the business.

            The Social Network" is a great film not because of its dazzling
            style or visual cleverness, but because it is splendidly
            well-made. Despite the baffling complications of computer
            programming, web strategy and big finance, Aaron Sorkin's
            screenplay makes it all clear, and we don't follow the story so
            much as get dragged along behind it.

        <h3>Source codes in the Movie</h3>
        <p>
          There’s quite a bit of code in The Social Network and it looks like
          it might have been written specially for the film.

        In a near future, a lonely writer develops an
        <b>unlikely relationship</b>
        with an <b>operating system </b>
        designed to meet his every need.

        <i>
          It's touching and funny and thought provoking and compelling and the
          music is a perfect partner to the picture. This is bravura
          filmmaking, risking all on trusting the instinct of a writer and the
          ability to create a complex, fascinating persona that the audience
          never sees. But we do feel her.
