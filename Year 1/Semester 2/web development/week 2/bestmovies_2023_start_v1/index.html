            Although for some people cinema means something superficial and
            glamorous, it is something else. I think it is the mirror of the
            world.

          I love movies about the Internet. As someone who has grown up just as
          much on the web as off it, I feel as if itâ€™s my virtual home, and
          inherently connect to films with social networks or hacking or viral
          media as major plot points perhaps more than films about any other
          subject.These movies thematically explore different aspects of the
          web, revealing both the positive and negative affects of living in
          such a connected world.

            Harvard student <b>Mark Zuckerberg </b>creates the
            <b> social networking site </b>that would become known as
            <b>Facebook</b>, but is later sued by two brothers who claimed he
            stole their idea, and the co-founder who was later squeezed out of
            the business.

              The Social Network" is a great film not because of its dazzling
              style or visual cleverness, but because it is splendidly
              well-made. Despite the baffling complications of computer
              programming, web strategy and big finance, Aaron Sorkin's
              screenplay makes it all clear, and we don't follow the story so
              much as get dragged along behind it.
